                        spillover infection. The first known human infections were in China. <br>
                        A study of the first 41 cases of confirmed COVID‑19, published in <br>
                        January 2020 in The Lancet, reported the earliest date of onset of symptoms <br>
                        as 1 December 2019. Official publications from the WHO reported the <br>
                        earliest onset of symptoms as 8 December 2019. Human-to-human <br>
                        transmission was confirmed by the WHO and Chinese authorities <br>
                        by 20 January 2020. According to official Chinese sources, <br>
                        these were mostly  linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale <br>
                        Market, which also sold live animals.

                        period for COVID‑19 is five or six days, but it can range from one <br>
                        to fourteen days with approximately ten percent of cases taking longer.

                        In July of 2020, a study published in<br>
                        BMC Infectious Diseases found that trained<br>
                        dogs could distinguish between human saliva <br>
                        samples from people infected with SARS-CoV-2 <br>
                        and non-infected samples with 94% accuracy.

                        The WHO has published several testing protocols for the disease. The <br>
                        standard method of testing is real-time reverse transcription polymerase <br>
                        chain reaction (rRT-PCR). The test is typically done on respiratory samples <br>
                        obtained by a nasopharyngeal swab; however, a nasal swab or sputum sample <br>
                        may also be used. Results are generally available within a few hours to <br>
                        two days. Blood tests can be used, but these require two blood samples<br>
                        taken two weeks apart, and the results have little immediate value.
